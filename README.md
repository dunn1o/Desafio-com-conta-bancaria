# Bank Account Challenge 🏦

This repository contains the solution for the programming challenge **"Bank Account Challenge"**, a **Java** project that simulates basic bank account operations through the terminal.

The goal of this challenge is to apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **input/output handling** in Java to manage a bank account with common operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.

- 📌 **Create a bank account** (account number, customer name, and initial balance)
- 💰 **Make deposits**
- 💸 **Make withdrawals**

> Note: This structure is typical of educational “bank system” projects proposed in beginner Java challenges.
